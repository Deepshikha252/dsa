Write a program to sort an array elements in Descending order using Insertion Sort Algorithm.



Insertion Sort :-Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works out how to sort cards playing in our hands.

Descending order :- Numbers are said to be in descending order when they are arranged from largest to smallest number. Such as 21, 17, 13, 9 and 3 are arranged in descending order.

Insertion Sort Algorithm

START
Step 1 : If it is the first element, it is already sorted. return 1;
Step 2 : Pick next element
Step 3 : Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list
Step 4 : Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is less than the 
value to be sorted
Step 5 : Insert the value
Step 6 : Repeat until list is sorted
STOP



Insertion Sort Program in Descending order
C C++ Java Python C# PHP

// Insertion sort in Java
import java.util.Arrays;
class LFC {
void insertion_sort(int arr[]) {
int size = arr.length;
for (int step = 1; step < size; step++) {
int key = arr[step];
int j = step - 1;
while (j >= 0 && key > arr[j]) {
// For ascending order, change key> arr[j] to key< arr[j].
arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
--j;
}
arr[j + 1] = key;
}
}
public static void main(String args[]) {
int[] arr = { 15, 50, -27, -4, 10 };
LFC is = new LFC();
is.insertion_sort(arr);
System.out.println("Sorted Array in descending Order: ");
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
}
}

Output

Sorted array in descending order:
50 15 10 -4 -27
